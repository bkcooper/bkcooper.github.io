## Experience
__Scientist, [Calico Life Sciences](https://www.calicolabs.com)__<br>
2015 - present

* Performed research on computational microscopy in [Andrew Yorkâ€™s
  lab](https://andrewgyork.github.io), with a particular emphasis on
  incorporating photophysics (e.g. photobleaching, FRET) into maximum
  likelihood reconstruction algorithms. Developed and implemented new
  reconstruction algorithms. Developed new theory of optimal exposure
  time given photoswitching behaviors.
* Assisted in support of microscopy core for ~50
  biologists. Responsible for training, support and troubleshooting of
  Micro-Manager (Java/C++ open source microscopy control software)
  on core instruments, including modifications to hardware device
  adapters.
* Collaborated on time lapse movie image analysis project with Calico
  biologists and Google machine learning engineers.

__Scientific computing contractor, National Institutes of Health__<br>2015

* Developed Python code to implement 3d structured illumination
  microscopy (SIM) reconstruction using maximum likelihood estimation
  for [George Patterson](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/about-nibib/staff/george-harold-patterson) at the NIH.

__Postdoctoral research associate, University of Maryland__<br>2014

* Supervised by Ian Appelbaum. Implemented proof-of-principle
  experiment for measuring Majorana fermions in semiconductor
  nanowires using novel capacitively coupled approach. Fabricated
  tunnel junctions and measured using custom-built low-capacitance
  cryogenic probe. Developed simulations in Python to assess
  experimental results.

## Education
__Ph.D., physics, University of Maryland__ <br>
Dec. 2013

* Thesis title: *[Multi-junction effects in dc SQUID phase
qubits](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/14932)*, advised
by Fred Wellstood.
* Designed, fabricated (e-beam and photolithography)
and measured superconducting devices for quantum computing. Developed
quantum theory of these devices, including effective Jaynes-Cumming
Hamiltonian. Prior to Wellstood lab, did theoretical work in condensed
matter.

__B.A., math/physics, Williams College__ <br>
Jun. 2001

* Graduated *cum laude*, with honors
* Thesis title: *Color tuning through
mechanical stretching in polyacetylene*, advised by [Daniel
Aalberts](http://panic.williams.edu). Theoretical examination of features
of a model of conjugated polyenes, motivated by fast photoisomerization of
rhodopsin.
