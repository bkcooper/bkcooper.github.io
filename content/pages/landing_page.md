Hi!

I'm a physicist, currently working as a scientist in Andrew York's [microscopy
group](https://andrewgyork.github.com) at [Calico](https://www.calicolabs.com).
The microscopy group has two major functions: to build and support a core
of instruments for biologists at Calico, and to develop novel techniques and
instrumentation. On the support side, I do microsope training and
troubleshooting, with a particular emphasis on [Micro-Manager](
https://micro-manager.org), an open source package for microscope control.
As a researcher, I develop computational techniques in Python for
improving object reconstructions from images. Prior to Calico, my background
was in condensed matter physics. In my Ph.D. under Fred Wellstood
at the University of Maryland, I studied superconducting qubits both
experimentally and theoretically. You can read longer summaries of my
research output [here]({filename}research_blurb.md).

I like mathematical thinking, modeling, reading, and learning new things.
