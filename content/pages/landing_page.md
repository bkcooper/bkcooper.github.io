Hi!

I'm a physicist, most recently working as a scientist in Andrew York's [microscopy
group](https://andrewgyork.github.io) at [Calico](https://www.calicolabs.com).
The microscopy group has two major roles: to build and support a core
of instruments for biologists at Calico, and to develop novel techniques and
instrumentation. On the support side, I did microscope training and
troubleshooting, with a particular emphasis on the open source
microscope control package [Micro-Manager](
https://micro-manager.org).
As a researcher, I developed computational techniques in Python for
improving object reconstructions from images, giving me strong experience
in signal processing, statistical inference, and optimization.
Prior to Calico, my background
was in condensed matter physics. In my Ph.D. under Fred Wellstood
at the University of Maryland, I studied superconducting qubits both
experimentally and theoretically. You can read longer summaries of my
research output [here]({filename}research_blurb.md).

I like mathematical thinking, modeling, reading, and learning new things.
