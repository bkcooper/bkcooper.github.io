Title: Diversions

## Moir√© SIM demo

I put [this](https://github.com/bkcooper/moire-sim-demo) together to
capture some of the flavor of structured illumination microscopy, an
influential microscopy technique that doubles the resolving power of a
microscope by patterning the light hitting the sample. Andrew York
presented this at the 2019 [ESRIC](https://www.esric.org) summer
school. Using a striped "illumination" mask printed on an overlay
transparency, you can get a surprisingly recognizable image out of
what looks like a mostly featureless array of stripes. These make fun
handouts.  The [Jupyter
notebook](https://github.com/bkcooper/moire-sim-demo/blob/master/sim-demo.ipynb)
in the repository explains what's going on and offers tips on building
your own.

## Inspiration

Bill Thurston, one of the great mathematicians of the 20th century, had
[this](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/43690/whats-a-mathematician-to-do/44213#44213) beautiful response to a question about how "mere mortals" can
contribute to mathematics. It is the best justification for science I know.
