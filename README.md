This branch holds the backing content for generating my Github user page.
I'm using [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) as a static site
generator. The theme is a somewhat modified version of [Flex](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex); my version is in the folder `flex-bkc` here.

## My workflow

To work with this, you'll obviously want Pelican. Two additional tools that
I've found helpful are `lesscpy` and `ghp-import`, both available via pip.
I've been using the .less version of the stylesheet in Flex but then explicitly
translating it to a minified CSS:
```
lesscpy -X style.less ./style.min.css
```
`ghp-import` is used in the Makefile here (generated by Pelican during the
setup.) `make github` runs Pelican using the publish configuration, uses
`ghp-import` to make a new commit to the master branch using the output
directory of the Pelican run, and then pushes it all to Github.
